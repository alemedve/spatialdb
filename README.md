## Mapping my neighborhood
The idea of this work is to choose a base coordinate point near home and register all the relevant places in a 2x2 blocks area around the point.

First implementation just has the point chosen and the area colored using [Leaflet JS](http://leafletjs.com/) and [Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com/).


## Final project: Spotters Map
This is a map of airplane pictures around airports from Flickr. Done in collaboration with @mariadelapuerta.
Airport locations are retrieved from [OpenFlights](http://openflights.org/data.html).
This data is parsed with [Papaparse](http://papaparse.com/).
Map is done with [Leaflet JS](http://leafletjs.com/) and [Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com/).
